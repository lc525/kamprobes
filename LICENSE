NOTE: The Kamprobes project is released under a dual open-source license:
  * GPLv2
  * Apache License 2.0 (ALv2)

Running kamprobes under Linux will require that you abide by the GPLv2 license,
as parts of the code make use of private and GPL-only Linux kernel symbols
(Making the module a derivative work of Linux).

However, the authors also explicitly license all parts of the code that can be
used without referring to those symbols under Apache License 2.0. For example,
this allows reusing kamprobes code that is not Linux-derived work in porting
to other operating systems or as part of closed-source applications.

GPL-only code will be marked by a notice like the following:
* This file is only licensed under GPLv2 and constitutes GPL-derived
* work.

The NOTICE file in the root of the project will contain a list of files where
such GPL-only code resides. Users wanting to make use of Resourceful under ALv2
must reimplement GPL-only functions before calling them.

All contributors to the project are required to allow the dual licensing as part
of signing their contributor agreement, before any patches are merged.

Version control commit history has been maintained when making this project
open-source. All historic code before public release (commit 527b373c407) is
still governed by this LICENSE despite this file and per-file notices not being
present at the time.
